# RubyStan

## Before you can start‚Ä¶

After cloning _this_ repository, you need to get `CmdStan` on board. The easiest
way is cloning the repository to a location of your choice:

    git clone https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan

You need to remember the path to that directory, as we need RubyStan to point
to that directory.

## Usage


```Ruby
# Tell RubyStan where your CmdStan repository is located.
# If you skip this step, the default value is "vendor/cmdstan"
# as I have cloned it there for my experimentation.
RubyStan.configuration.cmdstan_dir = "~/path/to/cmdstan"

# Prepare Stan compiler and assistent tooling
RubyStan.build_binaries

# Now we're ready to fit some models üë®‚Äçüî¨
# First, define your model. The first argument is a name,
# which is used to identify your model for re-use later.
model =
  RubyStan::Model.new("bernoulli-test") do
    # Stan code goes here as a string
    %q{
      data {
        int<lower=0> N;
        int<lower=0,upper=1> y[N];
      }

      parameters {
        real<lower=0,upper=1> theta;
      }

      model {
        theta ~ beta(1,1);  // uniform prior on interval 0,1
        y ~ bernoulli(theta);
      }
    }
  end

# Translate model
model.compile

# Specify data you've observed
model.data = {
  "N" => 4,
  "y" => [0,1,0,0]
}

# Run simulation to obtain samples from posterior distribution
model.fit

# Print result
puts model.show
```

The latter command shows the simulation result:

    Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
    For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
    and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at
    convergence, R_hat=1).
